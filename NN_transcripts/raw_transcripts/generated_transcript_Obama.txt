My children will be able to go to college. And if we don't gradually reform the system while protecting current beneficiaries, it won't be there when future retirees need it. So let's be clear, deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. The fact is, is that the American people want to make sure that we're not going to play brinksmanship but instead we're going to have to do to turn our economy back, and if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, we have to use taxpayer bailouts with American workers. And by broadening the base, we will do whatever we set up the same rights that can be done. But we can't stop there. As I've argued since I ran for this office, I will send this Congress a plan that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit. That's why we've ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students. And this year, I will work with states that break the rules to help our kids with the skills and training to fill those jobs. And that will add more than a million of our fellow citizens, and the future that built the largest middle class in history a source of tension that the United States and the United Kingdom an inherent advantage and that we revitalize our people. Now, a return to the international community, I've ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. So America has joined with Jill Biden to forge a new beginning in this new century. Fifteen years. And over time, in this new decade, it's time we stop treating childcare as a means. That's what we have to make sure that we keep our recovery will be choked off before the economy is stronger. I think some of the things I take responsibility for our future. Now, the American Jobs Act answers the urgent need to create jobs right here in America. So tonight we can't afford to do the right thing. The American people may have the capacity to make sure that we push on the American people that we will build on a new foundation for growth. This year, I'll be making a series of working with Republican and Democratic and Republican as a root canal. But when I ran for President, I promised to end the notion that this nation's promise was not the only way to offset them for the people of the world's history; a strong agenda that I believe will be the goal of all of our children. We are the only democracy. I know that the American people demand it, and I will be as a nation, it is making. Now, as I told us, is that the American people demand it, and I also understand why I believe the United States of America. The question is, is that the American people demand a better, and be: ( 1 going to take a couple of questions, guys. Major. Q After meeting with you, John Boehner came out and told us, “The House can't pass the health care bill it once passed; the Senate can't pass the health care bill it once passed. Why would we have a conversation about legislation that can't pass?” As a part of that, I will veto it. I have never been more hopeful about America. Not because I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must also address the crushing path to the world. I understand that. I still believe we can do what it takes to keep the promise of freedom and dignity for the State of Israel. As President, I have signed trade agreements with one that have been building for decades, but it won't. This is the price of bipartisanship. And that's why I strongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons. And any nation, including Iran, no one should be treated that way will be easy. The road ahead will only grow our economy. It will be good for our families, for our families, to make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. I've seen it in the second place at the beginning of this office. The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs. And that's a good thing. That's what a robust democracy demands. That's what helps set us apart as a nation. But there's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater - – something more consequential than party or political preference. We are part of the American people. The slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance to all the things that they believe in the rights of citizens. I want to say that this isn't the right thing to do. And over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And that's why I came here today. I want to thank all the educators from Sandy Hook Elementary who have come here as well the survivors I love you back. I do. I am very mindful that mere words are a little bit. But somehow, I think that the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views. Ari Shapiro. Q Thank you, Mr. President. How can I hope this: to a nation of highways, an American who wants to send a message to the American Dream, as a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that their lives will be better if other peoples ' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity. And their parents will go twice as far as our dreams and our deeds will take us. That's what we did. Our union was not a perfect union between the United States and the United Kingdom. We are the allies who landed at Omaha and Gold, who sacrificed side by side to free a continent from the march of tyranny, and help prosperity flourish from the ruins of war. And with the founding of NATO – - a British idea – - we joined a transatlantic alliance that has ensured our security for over half a century. Together with our allies, we forged a lasting peace from a cold war. When the Iron Curtain lifted, we expanded our alliance to include the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, and built new bridges to Russia and the former states of the Soviet Union. And when there was strife in the Balkans, we worked together to keep the peace. Today, after a difficult decade, I will send a new foundation for military to keep our country safe, and teaching them well, is something we help to protect our people and our communities from gun violence. But we have to do more to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from our own people. That's why I've been asking CEOs to give more to help the entrepreneurs and the dignity that will help our communities hire veterans, and we will provide the best in our success in this new century. All that are taking place in a generation of responsibility, the world is its promise. And it is the responsibility of all of our children. We recognize that Iran has tried to take advantage of the turmoil there, and where the more are a part of our American family. It will be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over. President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction. And going forward, it will be stronger 10 years from now, then we will not afford to pay. Today, the electricity we use is carried along a grid of lines and wires that date back to Thomas Edison a grid that can't support the demands of this economy. This means we're using 19th and 20th century technologies to battle 21st century problems like climate change and energy security. It also means that places like North Dakota can that can produce a lot of wind energy can't deliver it for the middle class, to secure our borders and enforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our Nation. But we can't do what we can do together, as a nation, that we will be able to continue targeting terrorists and supporting a sovereign Afghan government. Of course, our efforts must also address terrorist safe havens in Pakistan. No country has been a source of Egypt's advancement. And together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we will bring with our veterans, investing in this economy. We will support a tax cut that small businesses, businesses will get hit with a tax increase at all the world to make sure that women and small businesses. Now, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people, the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, DC, behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials, and support the best of the world's children, and to hold for the men and women of our Armed Services, and to my fellow Americans: I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the decade of war. Because there is no greater generator of wealth and innovation, with better, the rule of law and the world must begin. And the United States of America will emerge from Iraq. In the end, our security is no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite. And in fulfilling this task, we will not only extend humanity's reach in space we will strengthen America's leadership here on Earth. Now, even as we protect our people, we are the people who send us to take the risks that make this country great, a world where every day can be, every single day, and the future of our people and the strength of our Union is strong. We must act, knowing that today's victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall. My fellow Americans, we are a nation of immigrants, an America that can be a Jewish state, as we would not be able to stand by the Assad regime, but we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the Government they deserve. Now, that's what the American people want to see. Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things. I know that some issues have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know. I get it. I realize that the American people will be a strong and too many, with the peace and the world must not be a part of the American character, our ability to get that done. And to accomplish those who suffer the boot of oppression, when a leader that was once more trying to be able to support a child in a place where a child is badly sick. It would be a choice between two states. They have fought for a single dime. The days when the wages for a worker with a high-school plant, a young girl who looked like to work, a big round of applause. Lieutenant Governor Barbara O'Brien. Secretary of State Bernie Buescher. Your outstanding Mayor, John Hickenlooper. Your new Senator, Michael Bennett. Your old senator, now my Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar. Mark Udall is not here, but give him a round of applause anyway. One of the outstanding leaders who helped shepherd this process through in record time please give Max Baucus of Montana a big round of applause. Thank you, Max. To Secretary Federico Pena, one of my national reenact I would not be here if it were not for Federico. Thank you. To Representative Diana DeGette, who is a man who embodied the idea that I hear from here that you want to make a difference in the future. I know that the Bush administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual States. I know. The truth is, Rutgers, I came here today. I do believe that. And if there are good people on both sides of the best ideas about how to pay down our debt, we need to invest in the best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $ 140 to our economy every dollar. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's. They're developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to jumpstart job creation, restart lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, and it will not happen again. And to set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as a people. And the fact that our economy is growing faster. Step two years, at this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight. Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own rules. But we have to make sure that our food is safe and our water is clean, and that is a better country to do the same work as men, as well as Michelle's, to the family of our own people or the responsibilities of our own people. It is time to embrace the challenges that we face. Others would have America over extended, confronting every evil that can be found abroad. We must chart a more centered course. Like generations before, we must embrace America's singular role in the course of human events. But we must be as pragmatic as we are passionate; as strategic as we are resolute. When threatened, we must respond with force – - but is not just America's war. Since 9/11, al Qaeda's safe havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali. The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and to pursue our military, but it is universal in America. In the middle of the cold war is a testament to the world, we will stand here as well as the generosity and cooperation he. And for the next two years, this Nation has the right to insist on this as a partner with the United States, and to the world that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be. Of course, as we do, we must proceed with a sense of humility. It's not a matter of understanding and it should be fairly obvious that I intend to do as well. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done to us, and that is only to those who say we can and do our part will be. And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing that I believe can be the basis of territory and security provides a little to say the American Dream, to bring this bipartisan debt? What do you say to the future together un future de esperanza. And it may seem hard to be able to get it done. We're not forgetting. We can't forget. Your families still grieve in ways most of us can't comprehend. But so many of you have used that grief to make a difference not just to honor your own children, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here. I know that for many Americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others, and rightly so. If you haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has: a friend, a neighbor, a member of your family. You don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in a way that no matter who you are, what you look like, or what you look like, or what you look like, or what you look like, or what you look like, or you see 19 state legislatures go to the other side in the aisle, including, we'll get it all that our kids can graduate with the blessing of human liberty and the world's. I will place, even though these things not exist. But these things I believe in the power of our time and summon all the same things that we have to agree on every issue, and we are committed to its security. We can do this is the right thing to do. And I believe that we will be able to bridge every difference or solve every disagreement. There's a reason we have two parties in this country, and I am prepared to join them from the people that the people there are the only party that was the engine of our prosperity. What is required now is for this. This is not simply about the problem when people who are willing to work together and then we have a chance to get ahead. And let's be honest - – tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn't realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isn't being straight with you. It's time to believe in the choices. We have to tell Congress it's time to require a background check for anyone who wants to buy a gun so that people who are dangerous to themselves and others can not get a lot of money to get their hands on a gun? What's more important to do is just manufacture another crisis by next. We will, however, relentlessly said, “I will not be a strong, tight-knit family that has visited Tucson, people were just going to get a full hearing, just if you make such a “good ”. And be: ( 1 not sure that this will be an issue that comes in the future. I know that all of us in the best ways about I can do to make sure that we raise the minimum wage so that it's better for our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack. That was a battlefield for most of my life. And the one American family the chance to earn their citizenship. I will not go back to the days when the wages of the cars that their children could not be fulfilled. Put yourself in their shoes. Look at the heart of our nation's history. It's what I ran for President. It was at the center of last year's campaign. It drives everything I do in this office, and I know that the American people want to make sure people get a tax break for your country. That's what this debate is going to feel that the odds are still going to be big layoffs and a lot of people out of work, it's going to determine what happens to your kids and your grandkids. So one thing I really want to focus on this and let's make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can and must replace these cuts with a more balanced approach that asks something from everybody: Smart spending cuts; entitlement reform; tax reform that makes the middle class. And here's the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell: Bipartisanship can't be that I agree to bring down the cost of health care, or the budget, or reforming our housing and financial systems all these things will have real, practical implications for every American. And I am convinced that the decisions we make on these issues over the next few years will determine whether or not our children will grow up in a country where I live as a Government, as I believe, we must also reaffirm that the United States of America is not simply a challenge that we can not do for ourselves, but to the promise, the staying power, which is why I believe that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in a while of service, or a small business owner who has a contract with the law, and I am forever grateful for the only girl in America who we are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and we will defeat you. For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and we will keep our commitments to friends and partners. Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind. In part of the United States, we will be clear about the Jewish state and security of the United States. In this, the conflict between Israelis and Arabs is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the United States is moving forward in a region. The United States supports a Palestinian child can not be fulfilled with permanent occupation. And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for a new generation of our power and influence, or how we can respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America can not resist this transition, we must lead it. We can not cede to other nations the technology that will allow us to go forward with a common purpose, that they do for the Cuban people. As we speak, old factories are reopening to produce and our planet safer, or the future that we will pay off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead. I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with his dog, Tux. His final act of selflessness was to dive on top of his wife, sacrificing his life for hers. Everything everything Gabe Zimmerman did, he did with passion. But his true passion was helping people. As Gabby's outreach director, he made the cares of thousands of her constituents his own, seeing to it that seniors got the Medicare benefits that they had earned, that veterans got the medals and the care that they deserved, that government was working for ordinary folks. He died doing what he loved - – talking with us,” he said, “.. are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.” It lives on in the woman who said that they said on this day, Alan is asking you for the country to make sure that you are a better, because I want to make sure that we keep on doing the right thing, but to work with more urgency – - a higher purpose. Most Americans support the types of reforms I've talked about tonight. But I understand that because of the politics within the Republican Party has the right thing to do. I appreciate being here. I say this because I actually wanted to do something about this. This is not about politics. This is not about politics. This is about doing the right thing to do. And over the past year, I will be held accountable by the people, and the people of Arizona: I had to say that people in a couple of states may be able to go to the future where the children are gone behind. You know, the same thing was said, “I believe it would be a betrayal of your vote? What would you be a heavy lift where they weren't the right thing, but they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars are spent and struggling with tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations. Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen, and Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. And that's why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States and Iraq as the world's largest religions so that by disaster – - would we be as a nation with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: The United States has been difficult. The United States has paid a huge price to put off the TV, an economy that's become profoundly unequal. So far, we've become confused about this. We want to make a difference in the middle of the night. For six years, at each moment, at this moment, as we were doing more than forging a lifetime of hard work, and the Afghan people to pursue a new goal: a new world can be President of the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans. And that is why I must not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo. This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective: deterring the use of chemical weapons, and degrading Assad's capabilities. Others have asked whether it's worth acting if we don't take out Assad. As some members of Congress have said, there's no point in simply doing a “pinprick” strike in Syria. Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn't do pinpricks. Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver. I don't think we should remove another dictator with force we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next. But we do these things because we want to live in freedom and opportunity, and as long as be: ( 1 President, I intend to keep our promise to the American people and the world to rally around the world, and we will do so in several ways. First, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small-business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running. Second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values; Americans who will now be able to lead again. So let me tell you why I have to say that really sealed the deal. That was smart, because I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will. We will continue to hold us accountable, the United States is not yet finished, but we can continue to have a strong and healthy debate about those areas where we can not do anything about reducing inequality. It's true that government can not prevent all the downsides of the technological change and global competition that are out there right now, and we have a chance to use them to help with these cuts to happen, our sense of common humanity. No one disputes that chemical weapons will be held accountable by a nuclear weapon. At the same time, we will encourage more than a trillion dollars in our budget. That's why we have nutrition assistance or the program known as SNAP, because it makes a difference for a mother who's working, but even when she did her insurance more than a child is because they are a problem. She was a part of the American people. The Americans at the right to the most Americans to understand that Connie and her sister are the reason that I had to say to them today a little bit about your deliberations and how important that I take on this Congress legislation that would have to make sure the writers had good material. I also know that what I would like to begin today. Just a few days from now, we'll continue to take a chance to get a lot of good policy, and it's sure, a good idea. It will give a lot of kids to do and help more families who would get there. So let me set this country to be able to get done. And with the help of a new generation of our long term deficit is not just a place where we keep the promise of a secure Israel. I know there are many, Muslim and non Muslim, who question whether we pay for is we can't tackle inequality. And we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead. Now, these steps will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations. And if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approaches would work, is that the American people want to make sure that we keep on doing business as usual, and we can continue to have better rail systems than us, and Singapore having better airports than us. And we are so grateful for middle class families and everybody trying to work with us, and we want to help the tax code that will not happen if the American people want to go to college, and not the care of the law. That's what this debate is about. This is not about politics. This is not about politics. This is about these families. For too long, we've been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. Perhaps we see that now. Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can permit so many of our children to languish in poverty, or attend dilapidated schools, or grow up without prospects for a job or for a career. Perhaps it causes us to examine what we're doing to make sure that we are a better, because we know that spiraling health care costs are crushing families and businesses alike, we're taking the government open to get them off, and we're going to make sure that we're not going to have to do it. And I will not back down on the basic principle that I've got to be very difficult for us to get it. I know, I just can't wait for Congress. It was the gateway for a plan to get there. That's a lesson worth remembering - – that we have a serious debate about is what a lot of Republicans and Democrats, I know there's been a lot of publicity about this speech. The problem is, the American people are going to be looking for. And that's going to be my top priority over the next couple of years. Savannah Guthrie. Q Just following up on what Ben just talked about, you don't seem to be reflecting or second guessing any of the policy decisions you've made, instead saying the message the voters were sending was about frustration with the economy or maybe even chalking it up to a failure on your part to communicate effectively. If you're not reflecting on your policy agenda, is it possible voters can conclude you're still not getting it? Well, Savannah, that was just the first question, I think one of the things I take responsibility for is not having pushed harder on some of those issues. And I know you guys watched the whole thing isn't that would not be easy.” You can see it in the private sector not in the best of the best. And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can't afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break. And if you lose your job, you should pass it right away. Pass this jobs bill, and the typical working family will get a $ 1,500 tax cut next year. Fifteen hundred dollars that would have been taken out of your pocket will go into your pocket. This expands on the tax cut that Democrats and Republicans and Democrats at every issue, and I have to say, during a meeting right before I came out on stage somebody said, you know, it's not because of the business community in the face, you'd be a pretty good partisan. And I will not sign a plan to reflect the recovery I need to be a bipartisan agreement that we have to confront is a tough time for many in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me that this is going to be looking for. And here's what it means to send me legislation that are going to be looking for. And here's what the American people are looking for. And that's why I came here to Warrensburg today. I need you involved in this debate to remind Washington what's at stake. And over the past six years, deportations of criminals is the best way to ensure that a better job doesn't make this country stronger. And if we did not act, not simply in the future, and that we should be able to agree on providing these tax loopholes. But we have a huge spike in taxes for the future. Let me be clear once more. And this is an issue that comes up to what kind of country would have done in our own. So tonight, I am announcing that the American people aren't interested in refighting old battles. So again, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. And over the past five years, my administration will develop a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can't be one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that have the effect they have, on the left as they have earned the same rules from Main Street to Wall Street. This is the choice we have to agree on. This is the agenda that as the last thing we can do is to boost $ 1.5 trillion in savings by Christmas. Tonight, I am asking you to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act. And like Neera, I take this personally, I will send this Congress to give me an example of the Cuban people. I want to make sure that we keep the recovery going. But Washington sure isn't making a difference in terms of encouraging job growth is the right thing to do. And I think that the American people are absolutely concerned about that review. Some will be paid for with revenues from the very same drug that. We are the largest effort in history to make our economy weaker. It's been a part of different blocs of countries, the people of Cuba. And to do the right thing to do. But we have to recognize that one day's commemoration, no matter how special, is not enough. But tonight, be: ( 1 mindful of the words of President Eisenhower, who in discussing our national security said, “Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.” Over the past several years, we have lost that balance. We've failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis, too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay at an affordable rate. A new decade stretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this moment to, and it is time to heed the call of a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline. Now, yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission, and I anticipate that they're going to make a good living. And that's not how it would be easy. But the one thing that I could do is a personal and policy of the United States of America. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, “What's in it for me?” But I also know this problem is not going to be a whole bunch of areas where we can agree on, move forward on a package in a great story. And while some of you have a seat. I do not believe that. And if you ask them, well, okay, what's your economic agenda for the middle class, how are we going to grow our economy. It's not going to happen in any other nation, but also Democrats and Republicans to come together and let's start a business here at home, get the car out of a small business in Phoenix who haven't already sent a deep minimum wage. Some say that Judge Sotomayor saved baseball. Judge Sotomayor came to the District Court, she was forced to hang her fortunes on chance. To take a chance, but I did not have to pay, but don't tell me that Democrats won't keep America safe. We don't want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves and we certainly don't want bailouts for banks that break the rules. We don't need to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again. First, the cleanup. From the very beginning of this crisis, we have known our people, our outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, is here. Our wonderful Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar. Former Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis. Two of the outstanding members of the congressional delegation from Nevada, Steve Horsford and Dina Titus. Your own mayor, Carolyn Goodman. But we also have some mayors that flew in because they know what, in this election, at the beginning of a proposal we should, in my own, this Congress is all about. We need to change the world. Except maybe I've got one is to be able to get that done. Now, as Commander-in-Chief, I am here because this change is going to be more. Now is the time to do it. Now is the time to get it done. Real reform means strong border security, and we will do so. Okay? Let's see, by the way, that I can take steps to deal responsibly with the American people and the all of a child in the past and this time. The American people should know. Let me know that the other areas where the American people are looking for work and security. But I have to recognize that all of us have been at the core of the American people, a government that is all about them. But I believe that America holds within what's the envy of the world, but that's not what makes us strong. Our university, culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores. What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth the belief that our destiny is shared; that we embrace a world without taking new jobs in our own nation and our ideals: We will forge a new and comprehensive strategy that they may not be able to stand by and do nothing. And we will need to do that. But what I can't do is force for the next generation, and we will do so. I can promise that this has been a central front, we know what the American people want to see, to the next and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules. But we have to recognize that we are trying to be willing to do the same. I am not interested in punishing banks. be: ( 1 here because of the business interests we've got to take responsibility for meeting this challenge, not just in the coming weeks. A couple of CEOs lost their lives in this country. And be: ( 1 going to have a good and to prove that. But I think that the American people aren't interested in refighting old battles. So again, if you want to go backwards, you made it in a meaningful way somehow pits the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade. I will reform that we will be able to continue that tax code with companies that create jobs right here in America? That's what this debate is going to be hard choices. Now, that is exactly the kind of innovation we need when you can keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it. So tonight I want to be very clear. I can't do it, too. I don't know if everybody understood that Natoma is going to be a apocalypse, I think as some people have said that, in terms of your policies, isn't an impact. That's a good thing. That's what you need. I think it's a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Dr. Rice and the previous administration. But the notion that this community or the country would be better served by not hearing from a former Secretary of State, or shutting out what she had to say I believe that's misguided. I think they're tired of every day being Election Day in Washington. And at this critical time in our country, the people sent us here expect a seriousness of purpose that transcends petty politics. That's why be: ( 1 going to continue to seek the best ideas from either party as a result of decisions made in the executive suites on Wall Street; it was also the right thing to do. And obviously this is an issue that has been contentious. But as I said, I think what's going to be useful is for us to go. Now, I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle class taxes, which is why I urge the Senate to follow the House in the Senate, and he's going to be a whole bunch of areas where we don't have regrets because I feel like you have to figure out how are getting out of their own. I've been told that the last thing we, and the one thing will only happen if we don't make an agenda that begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the right side of the world. I also know civilization's debt to Islam. It was Islam, and the worst wildfires a war in Afghanistan demonstrates But a few months ago, I worked with Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every American. That's why, since I was talking about the anxiety Americans and I seem to know why I believe the vast majority of Americans - – not just the other voices. And we must be that nation. Third, we need to discuss is what the American people want to go to catch up with the issues that matter to you. And as I already said that I would have ever hoped for, and those with you don't have to pay out-of-pocket for tests to keep you healthy. So yes, we're working with Congress to create Enterprise Funds to invest in this country's future. Some and make no mistake those who adhere to the Top is in our power. We won't grow the economy. We are poised for progress. They will soar on [ the ] wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not only rob them of other countries, but to hold them accountable, it is our act, and a few more astronauts as well. Last but have been part of the fabric of people's problems. We've got to get student loan rates interest rates back down. So let's work with you, that's not who we are. It's time to close Gitmo. As Americans, we cherish our businesses need to become a doctor and their care. That's why I want to be very clear to a Republican, let's be able to get a lot done. Now, I understand that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for a job when they come home. Pass this bill, and hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged young people will have the pride of a first paycheck. And more Americans will have the satisfaction of starting their own business and flipping that sign that says “open ”. More folks will have the thrill of marching across the stage to earn a diploma from a university like this, and then know that they've got a job waiting for them. In other words, we can make a difference in the American story, which is a promise. That's why I believe it's important to us to rally collective action for the defense of our people, while building upon the broader belief of Roosevelt and Churchill that all nations have both rights and responsibilities, and all nations share a common interest in an international architecture that maintains the peace. We also share a common interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. Across the globe, nations are locking down nuclear materials so they never fall into the wrong hands because of our leadership. From North Korea to Iran, we've sent a message that those who flaunt their obligations will face consequences - – which is why America and the European Union just recently strengthened our sanctions on Iran, in large part because of the leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States. And while we hold others to account, we will meet our own obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and strive for a world without nuclear weapons. We share a common interest in resolving conflicts that prolong human suffering and threaten to tear whole regions asunder. In Sudan, after years of war and thousands of deaths, we call on both North and South to pull back from the brink of violence and choose the path of peace. To help our destiny is shared, and the United States of America. The American people have the right to insist upon education and security, energy and the Internet provide a window into the wider world - – a world of astonishing progress in places like India. This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas. Around the globe, we're standing with those who take responsibility - – helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity. Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power - – it is the principles upon which our union was founded. We're a nation that brings our enemies to justice while adhering to the rule of law, and respecting the rights of all our citizens. We protect our own freedom and prosperity. Now, partly, be: ( 1 confident because of the people who sent us here. I believe most of you are, too. Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, we can't do it right. In the meantime, for our workers and our economy. And that's why be: ( 1 sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $ 3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on a path to reach. Now, I recognize that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others, and not just a few who fought and died for their families gay and straight. So we don't also know that with a new generation of safe, we will not tolerate aggression across borders, and we will keep our commitments to friends and partners. Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind without fear. Pent up grievances fester, and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence. We also know that the opposite is true. Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace. America has never fought a war against a democracy, and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens. No matter how callously defined, neither America's interests nor the world's are served by the denial of human aspirations. So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries, America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal. We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi; to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings; to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran. It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation. And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that history is not a function of military force alone. We must use all elements of our power including our diplomacy, our economic strength, and the power of America's example to secure our interests and stand by our allies. And we must project a vision of the future that's based not just on our fears, but also on our hopes a vision that recognizes the real dangers that exist around the world. It's true that government can not come back to our nation. Because if we can be a better example, not whether it's not as if we can agree on, that we're all basically the old, we have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we are committed to the goal of a century that has touched the lives of so much of our people. Now, let me be clear: There is no question that the challenges we face can be a sustained effort to solve this problem? How many people who have lost loved ones in Iraq. The Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing. But they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office. But they led a nation. They marched as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal violence, countless daily indignities – - but they didn't seek special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them almost a century before. What they did here in the world who is their home, our entire economy, our own way, and we are from the international community as a whole. We may not be perfect, but for the sake of our children, our communities, the abuse and the Afghan people. It should be clear that Afghans will have to change. Research shows that one of the best investments we can make progress in the short term and we are ourselves as well. And I think that the brief that's been presented accurately reflects our views. Ari Shapiro. Q Thank you, Mr. President. You said a few minutes ago and you've said repeatedly that the country has to stop careening from crisis to crisis. Right. Q So with a few crises behind us and a few more crises ahead of us, taking a step back from this specific debate over the sequester, how it has meant some serious about what we are planning, consider the details of what we've laid out, and we are going to have to do it. I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle class taxes, which is why I urge the Senate to follow the House in the Senate, and he's going to be my degree. I agree with you. And it's going to hurt. I don't want us to be paralyzed on everything just because we disagree on this. This country is, is that the American people want. And if we do these things, then we'd help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and we could build an endless wall along with our own. I have always believed that we can continue to win the race in the 21st century. And UCM understands how important that is just too much of our time to meet the demands of the moment. And that is what the reforms be: ( 1 proposing are a people who are here illegally. We all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship. But for comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $ 1 trillion in the next two decades. And for the first time in a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer just a pathway to opportunity, it would do nothing to help families pay for the same work as men. Meanwhile, in the eight years since most of you started high school, we're also better off. You, too, as a result of the past half of our seniors, they were cut by their oil. A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history. A rural doctor gave a young child in Indonesia and the Rio Grande; the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot, and to make a home to call against those of the world's most dangerous and their families. And be: ( 1 sure that Prime Minister Cameron would agree that some days we could both use some on the other side, while advancing our technological capabilities with each step forward. And that's what we have to do with respect to the auto industry. As I said, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. We need to encourage that. And that's why I strongly reaffirmed America's commitment to create jobs, and the more painful cuts not just because the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else – - like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if you think, look, here's the bottom line. When the Iron Curtain would see no, too many of our citizens had that chance at that flag and that would have to pursue the best of the American people,” he said. “I think about i.e Bethea, the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon, South Carolina, a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom. She had been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this Chamber. She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. The letter asks us for help, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but it was a problem for good and fair and one that expands imaginations and lifts sights and gives those children the skills they need. That's why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome; to Ottawa and Sydney; to Dhaka and Kigali we honor them not as makers of war, but of wagers but as wagers of peace. Let me make that effort. And we will also recognize that if we fail to do that we can. For we, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths – - that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make up their lives to be better, and our hearts, we can make progress in the short term and invest in technologies in the long term that start giving us the tools to reduce greenhouse gases and that people in this Chamber, or to make those words with a New Deal, declared a War that can not help us grow the economy or in the world. It will not be a heavy lift. In the days that, I said, the United States of America is normalizing relations with the Cuban people. I want to thank my partner in the midst of two wars in the region. The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq. We have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the Government they deserve. Now, it's true that the painful legacy of discrimination means that African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans are far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity higher unemployment, higher poverty rates. It's also true that women still make 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. So we're going to have to do more to encourage private savings and shore up the promise of Social Security for future generations. And remember that there is a pathway to earned the job, that is a legacy for which all major economies meet their responsibilities to create American jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear powerplants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And, yes, we can protect more of our citizens, and we will do what we have to strip away. We must chart a more centered course. Like generations before, we can say this is the right thing to do. And as we welcome, like, and that's the right thing to do. And be: ( 1 not going to anticipate that they're not going to have to do to turn our economy back, and if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, we have to make sure that we don't have a huge spike in taxes for middle class families. Not only would not help all of the best ideas. So I want to make sure that we're talking about both. But if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on this issue? And I think there are a lot of folks out there who have a lot of money out at the beginning of the last week the issue. I know you didn't have a good reason, because if you think about the fact is not whether you do is. And what we're going to do is that the American people aren't interested in refighting old battles. So that's how we will ensure that our economy is growing and providing opportunity for it to the American people. As Americans, we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. And on nights like this one, the change has been made by Israelis and Palestinians in Washington. And a lot of them I had a tough election, but a lot of them will be able to get it done. But I think that the biggest uncertainty has been more promising to see their coverage through the first place and a high school diploma. And I know how to pay for this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get a tax cut if they hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our Nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products. Tomorrow I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation's goods, services, and information. We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these Americans. Let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can make college more affordable. We can close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take that money and give tax breaks to help families with child care or retirement. And if we did these things together, then I will be supportive of us sticking to that deal. I saw this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President's Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets, not because they don't have a higher education. And next week, Michelle and I will bring together college presidents and non profits to lead a campaign to help more low income students attend and succeed in college. But while higher education may be the surest path to the middle class, it's not the only one. So we should offer our people the best technical education in the world. That's why we've worked to connect local businesses from being exposed to mercury, or laws that prevent every person a safe haven for terrorists who can afford and protect the rights of all Afghans, and to the world that the United States will launch a new goal: By 2035, 80 percent of America's electricity will come from the shadows and will be the North Star that guides our efforts to solve this problem. The EPA is under a court order that says greenhouse gases are a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction. And I think one of the things that's very important for me is not to our politics. You know, I just want to mention a few. First of America, the easiest thing for me to do is to see if they want to suggest modifications that would deliver faster and more effective reform to our future. Given this is not simply a test that in a world where the prosperity must be our common cause. And that's what our enemies are not going. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker, John Boehner. And as I said, I know that I would not be a heavy lift rocket small steps to encourage the job. So I want to make sure that we're talking about both. But if we don't act, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, we can't do it again. This is a matter of history, but because the one indispensable nation that allows the support of these weapons will be held accountable. Sanctions must exact a real price. Intransigence must be met with increased pressure and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one. One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to seek a world without them. In the middle of the last century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear: All will have access to peaceful nuclear power; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them; and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament. I am committed to upholding this treaty. It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy. And be: ( 1 also a judge on the Court in the past, but this is an American reaching for new heights, stretching beyond what previously did not seem possible. And so Israel is, the election comes of the next two years, I will send this Congress a plan that will not be a heavy lift. And yet, some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms. Think about that. They're not just saying they'll vote “to make it easier for people to participate. And if this bill is going to be more than a year from now, then there's a lot of posturing. It's a plan that's been broken; a system that be: ( 1 proposing. Now, I don't have to wait for Congress. Because the choices that we send in the midst of these storms, the American people will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have the thrill of marching across the stage to earn a diploma from a university like this, and then know that they've got a job waiting for them when they graduate. What makes us special a lot of times we talk about next year, I want to focus on for the next few months, that's what we have done. I think the overwhelming message to the American people are expecting, and that you pointed out that for this, the process of all people is the same path to put people a few key days. And I will reform in this place which will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who still can't afford coverage, and 95 percent of all small businesses, right here, in this country, who still can't afford the lower priced insurance. To cut the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break. It's not a matter of punishing their success. It's about promoting America's success. In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for the American people, to make sure our businesses are competitive around the world, that we're not going to need to be strong and we're going to need to be united. None of the challenges we face lend themselves to simple solutions or outwork slogans. Nor are the answers found in any one particular philosophy or ideology. As I've said before, no person, no party, has a monopoly on wisdom. And that's why I came here today. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, America's happy warrior the best Vice President anybody could ever hope for Joe Biden. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you, too, as a father, is rooted in my own experience as “the peace that the future could be a good man. Preacher by 13, pastor by 18, public servant by 23. He did not exhibit any of the cockiness of youth, nor youth's insecurities; instead, he set an example worthy of his position, wise beyond his Cleveland, and a Great Recession. You've seen economic and technological and cultural shifts that are profoundly altering how we work and how we communicate, how we live, how we form families. But I will not send our troops into harm's way unless it's truly necessary; nor will we consume the world's best products. And as a nation, we will be better for our economy. It will be good for our families, for our kids, to ensure that more and more are readying to train and achieve new workers. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college. I thought I'd like to talk about how we can afford to give them a better shot. If you still don't like Obamacare and I know you don't even though it's built on market-based ideas of choice and competition in the private sector, then you should explain how, exactly, you'd cut costs, and cover more people, and we will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer. This time, CEOs won't be able to get more than $ 2.8 billion to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on. Let me also address the issue of Iraq. Unlike Afghanistan, I announced a series of the Republican Convention were more than happy to the last four months, and we will bring with the industry to give scientists and foreign oil than ever before. And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not a win for anybody, this is a loss for the American people. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments, provided they govern with respect for all their children for their own purposes. So we have to do that, we will face more drought, more famine, more mass displacement all of which will fuel more conflict for decades. And for decades, we will support a process in which the Libyan people can build a new sense of responsibility. To help the tax code, we will work with the EU to facilitate more trade within the region. We should be able to support free from the wealthiest and $ 4,575,397.97, and that focus on the progress in this country, every child should have access to a complete, and we're confident that we will help create jobs for the help of a world where our businesses have no interest in endless destruction. They understand that some in the region have achieved more wealth and more power than ever before. We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. And we will make sure that we don't have enough information to act. And that means addressing some of the underlying problems that led to this turmoil and devastation in the first place. Now, one of the most significant contributors to this recession was a financial crisis as dire as any we've known in generations at least since the ' 90,786,064.02, which. And that crisis was born of a failure of responsibility from Wall Street all the way to Washington that brought down many of the world's largest financial firms and nearly dragged our economy into a second Great Depression. It was that failure of responsibility that will continue to play an Iraq that lasts into our budget to emerge from the shadows. We've cut our oil companies will receive a tax cut; that's the hard cost of health care. A lot of CEOs I hear from here that you can get the most bang for an America that is safer and cleaner. Moreover, even when the free market works for us, is our strength, our resilience, and our environment are far greater. That's why, after a crisis of the United States, in order to reach a nuclear armed Iran, secures America and our allies including the United States, our Quartet partners, and the Arab states will need to continue every effort to get beyond the current impasse. I recognize how hard this is to make sure that we keep on doing business as usual, and we will do, to the marketplace so that we're all of us. The question we must do, we will do, and that is only to win the race in the 21st century. And given the stakes involved. The whole for this country would be easy. The road to recovery will not be straight. We will make progress and we can agree on every issue nor should we do. I believe that we must make sure that we're not doing enough. But we can not do. As we discuss these issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility. Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let's use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other. And when there is no lending, families can't get a job to their own. It is not about stifling competition, stifling innovation; it's our plan to keep ourselves, and we can continue to help all the world has not done. In the end, the recovery plan, no matter how many of these plans will be paid for our future. In fact, the system is rigged in states that have been the cost in this office. And be: ( 1 requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. Because America has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have to make sure that we can wind down and low cost us now. It's also true that government can solve all of our problems, but we don't think that government can solve all of our problems, and we will provide that kind of training they need to get it done. Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. And that means simplifying our corporate tax code in a way that closes wasteful loopholes and ends incentives to ship jobs overseas. And by broadening the base, we can actually lower rates to encourage more companies to hire here and use some of the money we save for our kids. That's why, over the past six years, we've been at the forefront of innovation and education. And most of all, I can say that we're going to have to do more for our economy. It is time to put in place tough, when we do. And if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approaches would work, is that the American people want to go through. When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have a package, more Americans will have the satisfaction of starting their own business and flipping that sign that says “open ”. More folks will have the thrill of marching across the stage to earn a diploma from a university like this, and then know that they've got a job waiting for them when they graduate. What makes us special a lot of times we talk about the American people. And so I've got to expect more from this Congress, I believe, as I said, great, I think we'd be misreading the election. We are not quitters.” These words must be that nation. I know, look, I know that some issues of the House will see if I speak to the House for passing such a bill last year. And you should be able to get a lot done; that's the same thing that I could to make sure that every American knows the security. And that is why I will keep the promise of a multiethnic, multisectarian democracy. The Iraqi people have rejected the perils of political violence in favor of a decade. But at times in the midst of Civil War, I have also learned that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda a huge blow by killing its leader, Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was no martyr. He was a mass murderer who offered a message of hate – - an insistence that Muslims had to take up arms against the West, and that violence against men, women and children, each and only one people in their own land and their families all their lives and their allies, their life, and their families share their lives to carry on a better life. And it makes the largest and in our society. Tyranny is still with us whether our military efforts, we will do whatever it takes to help the small business that are more and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our economy, and we are a nation that we have to change. We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Washington, we had a lot of fun on the campaign trail by saying that the Republicans were drinking a Slurpee and sitting on the sidelines while you were trying to pull the car out of the ditch. But the point of the story that we've talked to Republicans that I would have ever hoped and to make a better difference in a serious way.” “We are not going to happen. I don't know if everybody understood that Natoma is in the hospital right now, I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for a month of an immigrant realizes her dream. The days when she was a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA's office, serving under the legendary Robert Morgenthau, an early mentor of Sonia's who still sings her praises today. There, Sonia learned what crime can do to provide relief for the people. To the American people to understand the challenges that exist in America, we have to keep our troops to the windy plains of the Dakotas and the sunny deserts of the Southwest. Even as a nation of the American people and the friendship must be. For as the Court chooses which I think of Leonard Abess, a bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state of the American people, her children are the United States to promote justice. And though I will not only seek a new idea those who are the most endangered by extremism. Public opinion has turned. The Pakistani army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan. And there is a whole lot more than a half hour to school, a family with Democratic and Democratic is: ( 1 also going to help, the more than we are not here because this country has been willing to work hard to make it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of the future it. And as I already said that I would have made this happen, and I am prepared to do hard things and to push back to a vote in the Senate. I did not go to this plan. But I also know this: If you had the most talented, skilled citizens, and those are the folks who are going to make a good living. The days when the wages for a worker with a high-school set of rules from the critical decisions about tonight. And when a vote comes to the deficit, we've worked with Republicans to lay off the same amount of health care and their employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride in their labor and will end. And I want to make sure that we're not cutting into education that is the right thing to do. That's why, over the past six years, we've made progress. But all of us could potentially focus. Number one, I can be a tough, and I want. But here's the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell: Bipartisanship can't be that I agree to all the things that they believe in, because the truth is more pronounced given the changes sweeping the Arab world. I understand that with the uncertainty in the region people in the streets, changes in leadership, the rise of non secular parties in politics it's tempting to turn inward, because the situation outside of Israel seems so chaotic. But this is precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace. Because no wall is high. It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy. And be: ( 1 also the President of the United States. And while the means of this office, we have to confront the fact that our government was founded upon the ideal that is etched above its entrance: Equal justice under the law. I know the people of the Senate are here, I made the largest investment in basic research funding in history. And the inevitable costs, the unintended consequences that would come with war means that our nation faces. I don't have a choice to protect the American people, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's the answer that led to the Internet. We've got to control all of Eretz out. I know that if we stay focused, as Lilly did – and keep standing for what's right here in America. That's what this movement was all about, and we can find a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is just, representative, and accountable to the Iraqi people, the Cuban people, and the state of our Union will always be safer. The American people demand it, because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here at home, we have a higher education, from a government that is strong, a world where extremists live up to you. So let's be clear, the success of all people is the only path to restore the promise of innovation in America. That's what we need. But the source of our friendship extends beyond mere interests, just as it has transcended political parties and individual leaders. America is a country that can achieve whatever it sets out to accomplish. I know that some of you have the power to make health care reform, just as we make you a mission to restore that basic bargain between the United States and Israel as well. Those of us here tonight, we know that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of revolution, and in the coming weeks. A couple of other acknowledgments I want to make to the better place to the American people. And I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle class taxes, which is why the reforms that will not be easy, and there will be setbacks. It will not produce the security we want to leap into the future. I think that in the face of these challenges come. I believe that every person should have the chance to accomplish if they are a people. I know many of you in the financial industry, I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs right away. It's called the same bill bill in the next few months, and especially the tax cuts for the Cuban people. So here's what the American people are looking for. When I first ran for this office, I laid out a set of Wall Street reforms. The plan will get to see more than two centuries of trial, and it will see their lives in this country. In the coming days and weeks, I'll be launching other aspects of the plan. We will need to stabilize, repair, and reform our banking system, and the right to choose your own leaders and their grandchildren. Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of the best ideas for the American people, while keeping our energy bills, and we will make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again. First, the cleanup. From the very beginning of this crisis, the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation's history an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen, who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters. We now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil. Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf. And I've authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard members along the coast. These servicemen and women in uniform, their only would have to be followed by the battles for peace. The fact is, is that our economy is in a way that advances our values and strengthens our security for every American. Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on our own. Other steps will require congressional action. Today, make no mistake: The ultimate success of democracy in the world won't come because the United States dictates it; it will come because individual citizens demand a say in how they are governed. There is no soil where this notion can not be our power - – by itself - – it is to see if we want to honor our people to know why not only the future we seek, but only if we can develop new technologies in areas that America will do or the security of a Palestinian who is the United States of America. So we can not do is use this tragedy as one. This is not a situation where be: ( 1 committed to working with them, and we can continue to protect its people and our allies. At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow fact is why I stand here before you confident that you can make the right choices away from fear and division and paralysis, and toward cooperation and innovation and hope. But make no mistake: This transition will begin to anyone who has been so supportive of the space program in Afghanistan and the extremist safe havens in Pakistan. And I will not relent in this hall, where Israelis and Palestinians are the reason to see the fact that the “stand your ground is to make sure that the only thing that was my hope is that. But what I think about when I came here to Cairo to seek a few more people. The question is whether, as one people will be able to get a lot done. Now, the truth is, is that not everybody. That is what the reforms be: ( 1 proposing. It's time to make that point. And this is not a win for anybody, this is the defining challenge we can take when it is not a win for the next two years relitigate arguments that we had over the last two years. With respect to the budget, I think about the choices that we have to do is it. Now, the truth is, is that given we all have a choice and to strengthen Medicare for the long haul. But the one thing that I could do is that the American people want to make this country stronger. And I am a plan that rewards responsibility, lifting two million Americans from poverty. And when our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make. Now, I recognize that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is the time to get it done. Real reform means strong border security, and we will do more to restore the link between what we are and how important we stand in the way of progress. We will do what we believe in this. This country is, is that the American people want us to work. And that means addressing the kind of action we need. I think we can make the right decisions about how to move forward. I recognize that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others, and we have a state to say that our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. And be: ( 1 sure President Castro would say the same thing I know, I just want to mention a few. First of America, the easiest thing for me to do is we're not going to rule out ideas because they're Democrat or Republican; we want to be this and our water, or not the only way to create a new corps of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in Muslim majority countries. And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations, and social entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world. On science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development in Muslim majority countries and to help transfer ideas to mark, to the marketplace so they can create more jobs. We'll open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops. Today be: ( 1 announcing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio. And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child and maternal health. All these things must be done. And that's why we will support our agreement around the world is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It's why we stand with our military to meet our own countries. And we will not only extend humanity's reach in space we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia. Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education and the Internet provide a window into the wider world - – a world of astonishing progress in places like India and Indonesia and Brazil. Cell phones and social networks allow young people to connect and organize like never before. And so we know that we're doing more of our fellow citizens; so that we are ready for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons, and to support a world without them. In the middle of the last century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear: All will have access to peaceful nuclear power; our citizens of the American people, and the people of the region are taught to hate them. For Palestinians, it has meant suffering the humiliation of occupation, and never living in a nation of their own. Moreover, we must also admit the basic research that led to the Internet and the computer chip to the Middle East, as it impedes partnerships that could bring greater security and prosperity and empowerment to ordinary people. For over two years, my administration has worked with the parties and the international community to end this conflict, building on decades of work by previous administrations. Yet expectations have gone unmet. Israeli settlement activity continues. Palestinians have walked away from talks. The world looks at a conflict that has grinded on and on the table for achieving our objectives. America will do what we must do. And as we welcome a new, and a new, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life. We'll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they've earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care – including the mental health care – that they need. We'll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home. And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families. Let me tell you what I believe is best for America. If we want to honor the hard work of being in our history. And that is what the reforms be: ( 1 proposing are a people of the financial system, to us now, what we're doing and there are a whole lot of folks who are book smart and have no common sense. And that's why I came here to Warrensburg today. I do. I want to focus on the next five years, the next 10 years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future. We live in a world where our economy is growing. So the one that we spend, and the economy is being dealt with national debt to raise a high school diploma. To compete, higher education is the most meaningful reform of our future. Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why be: ( 1 sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. Keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt. Understand, you've got to earn it. You've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that America is in decline or to go down that, so we're going to reach out to them, and they may shut it back. It is not a win. That's the truth. You'll meet them if you haven't already. So the fact is what the American people want to see. Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things. I know that for many, you should be able to get a lot of money to get rich and going public, if they work hard. A lot of young people don't know this, but if you've taken out my ideas to give every American a chance to succeed. If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity, because I believe in the resiliency of a nation that's bounced back from, whoever proposes them. And that's why I have reaffirmed America's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions. We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight. Now, let us finish the work at hand. Let us responsibly end these wars, and reclaim the American Dream that is at the center of our story. With confidence in our cause, that our nation is stronger and can not be broken. If we're not only improved relations with the same old players and expect a different result of decisions made around kitchen tables across America, which is why I can stand here before you confident in the future. I know that debate will be a tough debate about how to get there. As a result, millions of people a free and open Internet, put their jobs in a race. And to truly transform our economy, and our privacy. But now, we must show that we will keep working, nor the words of the international community must mean something we can not do, as a nation, that we will be able to bridge our differences. The question is, is that same-sex couples are a group or two leaders that have lost; it said, “where we are met with cynicism and debt, and doubt, and can not turn. That's what we can. And if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approaches would be able to lift ourselves out of the shadows and to improve it. As I've said, we know what America is a friend and two leaders of his interest. And I think that's what I said. I have never been more hopeful about America. It's about filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaida's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008. And in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for broader effort to make a promise in which we need to ensure that the Iranian government forsakes nuclear weapons. Peace is far more preferable to war. And the inevitable costs, the unintended consequences that would come with war means that we have to do everything we can to try to resolve this diplomatically. Because of the cooperation between our governments, we have a profound commitment to forge a century of our future. We must keep working through forums like the G20 to put in place global rules of the road to prevent future excesses and abuse. No country can hide from the dangers of carbon pollution, which is why we must build on what was achieved at Copenhagen and Cancun to leave our children a planet that is safer and cleaner. Moreover, even when the free market works as it should, both our countries recognize that no matter how responsibly we live in our lives, like our national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, our troops have moved on fire. This is true in Afghanistan, the light of a secure peace can be seen in the distance. These long wars will come to an end. Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to our nation. Since the region may be unsettling, but its promise in the world. It's what we have done. The American people demand it, because they rise up and insist on the principles that we have. I recognize that times have changed in our country, our economy has not been and that's the time for our leadership. And we are going to be areas, particularly around, for example, reforming how Washington works, and that deficit reduction is not just a policy of normalizing relations with the Cuban government. The United States of America is normalizing relations with the Cuban people. And today, I want to share with you my vision of what I believe in the right. We can't do what we can do, and that would be an American problem. This is not a danger for our country. It is our destiny. For when we the primary and general election. Here are the details that every American needs to understand the future - – the idea of all people. For while the many of the storm, we will be met by dark forces that will test our resolve, it is strong, sovereign, and able to stand on its own two feet. Indeed, our efforts in this young century have led us to a new concept for NATO that will give us the capabilities needed to meet new threats threats like terrorism and piracy, cyber attacks and ballistic missiles. But a revitalized NATO will continue to hew to that original vision of its founders, and to the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the government, they have stood for civil rights; it's no longer; that the dreams of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; our security and prosperity lie deeper fears: that ancient jobs are more than 60 years. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting people and work for the rights of all human beings – - men, women, and leaders from getting their hands on a gun. Senators of our outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, is here. Our wonderful Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar. Former Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis. Two of the outstanding members of the congressional delegation from Nevada, Steve Horsford and Dina Titus. Your own mayor, Carolyn Goodman. But we also have some mayors that flew in because they know how important that they are so much, that we have in abundance and is very cheap, but is who we are here in our sights. We have finished a difficult, and we are better off for our kids. To each other people's, and we are better off for our kids. They are there. We are the people Emerson wrote of, “who for truth and honor's sake stand fast and suffer long;” who are “never tired, so long as we can see far enough.” That's what America is. Not stock photos or airbrushed history, or feeble attempts to define some of us as it has to be done. The role of citizen in our democracy does not end with our freedom. That's who we are. We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer, women who could do as much as any man and then some. And so, I think there are a lot of people have a choice to make. I believe the United States of America Good evening. To the United States Corps of Cadets, to the men and women of our Armed Services, and to my fellow Americans: I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan. That's what drew our forebears here. It's how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and we will be waving the white flag while other countries forge ahead in a global economy. We must jumpstart industries that create jobs, and open new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. That's what helped us into this crisis, it's also incumbent on us to rebuild it stronger than before. We don't want us to be able to agree on a mechanism to get community banks that are already making the right thing, you can't get any job. I have no doubt that NASA can continue to fulfill this role. I will not walk away from these new rules. Number four, the last key component of reform. These Wall Street reforms will give shareholders new power in the financial system. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of Americans and work for all lets us go to college, and by the way we work to bring down our deficit in the years to come. Now, I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle class taxes, which is why I urge the Senate to do the same. So tonight I ask every American to commit me to this point. But I also know this: If you can't afford to wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. So tonight, be: ( 1 announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in the last. It would be in place for a diplomatic effort. And today, the American people must also be recognized. Put yourself in their shoes. Look, one of the things that are helping us grow. And I believe we can do this again. As we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That's why we have speed limits and child labor laws. The challenges we face are great. The problem is, is that you can change, and by the people who wrote to me say that with a young man from Kenya and a young woman who would rather cut their hours back to work. be: ( 1 not going to get a better bang for the wealthy, and that is now. In fact, we've often accepted more income inequality, and some of the students who lost their lives in their own home and graduate than any of it. I want to thank all the families who lost their lives on the road. But we can also fight it back. And I agree that we can't just continue with business as usual then maybe we can get a lot of negative reinforcement. And I know you will be the first time to do, which is a problem restricted to a small business owner who has a lot of money, and we can't afford to know, it's because of who they are, or what you look like, or where you love it doesn't matter whether you're black or white; Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for a night without delay or a conservative America; a black America or a white America but a United States of America. I am grateful to finish this journey with the United States Senate. And that is why I have reaffirmed America's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions. We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight. Now, let me be clear: None of this country are different, but that we have to change. I know that for many, the people who are gathered here, the people of Newtown, will have the right to access peaceful nuclear power, so that a transition in Muslim majority countries will see their economies crippled by a cut off in energy supplies. As we did in the Gulf War, we will not tolerate aggression across borders, and we will keep our commitments to friends and partners. Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind without. But if you're able to stand up for the values of a secure Israel. I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's what I came to Washington to do. That's why, for this final one, I think everybody is going to be a whole bunch of areas where we agree on a page or a laundry list of programs. I know that for many Americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others, and rightly so. If you haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has: a friend and the character of our country. The United States has condemned these actions, and our families are full of honorable men and women, and we are from a position to respond to the 9/11 attacks. And yet, we must lead on behalf of the prosperity of our citizens, and we are a people who see the millions of Americans who do not have to think that we can do this again. And that's why we're going to need to be strong and let's face it, but to keep our investments in everything else – - like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans and for the country. And for the Jewish people, this is the largest investment in our communities and the world to support those who need to pursue their own country. And to do what we believe in the rights of others. So we can make a difference in the 21st century that threatens a strong strategy that we seek to a global world without the only crisis since we passed in the next four years, and we'll open more than a decade, which will lead to our security, and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as the unshakeable. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may be true when it comes to a responsible end. And this is a temporary stop on our economic crisis. In the last century is, we have to confront a more and more of the entire tax cuts. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, “What's in it for me, not just about the entire burden of deficit reduction when a hardworking issue of this sequester, and the Senate Finance Committee. And I think it is important for all that stuff coming at all of us, including me, to work harder and lift to the people of Haiti. And I will keep pushing for this plan for all Americans, for not only a secondary interest. Today I want to make sure that we're talking about both. But if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send this Congress a world that you will, and will not, or solve what we did. That we are still bound together as one people. We will continue to have a strong and more peaceful for your country. I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington. But I stand before you tonight because I suspect that a few of the things I think every day, and I have one answer: Pass a bill. I recognize that in too little so long, we have to move forward, we must say openly to each other through the House and the Senate, as a country, we will be a lot of strong interaction behind the scenes. But I think setting the right tone publicly is going to be important and for all the way for it. Now, the American Jobs Act answers the urgent need to create jobs right away. But we can't stop there. As I've argued since I ran for this office, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just for them. That's how we start rebuilding trust. That's how we honor our kids; a better shot. If you believe in the right now, in terms of how you can get ahead. Let's face it together. Let's get it done. Let's get it done. Let's get it done. Let's get it done. Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and our workers; a strong sense. That's why we're going to need to be strong and let's face it, but to the American people and the world will need to change. That's what the American people want to go. That's why, working with you are not making. And I want to make sure that we're talking about both. But we do expect Washington to solve all our problems. We must never forget that the things we've struggled for, and fought for all the sacrifices that they have earned the highest unemployment rate, and we will do whatever it takes to help the small business that are going to make sure that we don't have a huge spike in taxes for middle class families. Not only would be a refutation of the forgiveness expressed by those families that will get that job and that can be quickly. I won't pretend that we will make sure that we're not cutting into education that is the right thing to do. That's why, even as we prosecute two wars, we have put businesses to work together and make this country stronger and more competitive by instilling confidence here at home and across the globe. Markets depend on that confidence. Part of what led to the turmoil of the past two years was on this. Fifth, we've put in new leadership and to prove that at the same time as part of the American character, our ability to make our country stronger. And it's an honest disagreement, and the United States of America is normalizing relations with the Cuban people. And now is what I believe that we will continue to do that, that is what makes us strong. That's how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure our forests and waterways, our crop lands and snow-capped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. That's what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared. We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know that they have killed thousands of Muslims in our country have made their living from the water. Because there will be more than the crisis of our time, our security and leadership has made a difference in the history of the past. For decades, we have known the United States and the United Kingdom have a better future. And we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it's ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that will put people in their own way. And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war. That is what makes us different. That is our responsibility as well. Yes, we do. And I believe that America holds within a means that has been made for progress. But all of us must recognize that education is the most important predictor of income in our history; that we have a huge opportunity and people in this country, and you know, maybe this is the right thing, but it does require us to find common ground in order to make their voices heard from the people, which we're going to have to do something to prevent another crisis by next. We will, however you, the people of Newtown, I see it in the worker who will be,” when you come home from a young person in a while but every single day that I come here today to find a historic compromise that will enable both people to live in peace, and at least in part because of you; that the “sweet the course of a young woman dying in the streets, waving the American flag and singing the same anthems man in the Magna Carta. It was here, in this very hall, where the rule of law first developed, courts were established, disputes were settled, and citizens came to petition their leaders. Over time, the people of this nation waged a long and sometimes bloody struggle to expand and secure their freedom from the crown. Propelled by the ideals of the Enlightenment, they would ultimately forge an English Bill of Rights, and invest the power to govern in an elected parliament that's gathered here today. What began on this island would inspire millions throughout the continent of Europe and across the world. But perhaps no one drew greater inspiration from these notions of freedom than your rabble-rousing colonists on the other side of the Atlantic. As Winston Churchill said, the “. Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and English common law find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence.” For both of our nations, living up to the ideals enshrined in these founding documents has sometimes been difficult, has always been a tension between the desire to allow markets to function without interference and the absolute necessity of rules to prevent markets from falling out of kilter. But managing that tension, one that we've debated since the founding of this nation, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust. Tomorrow I will visit Buchenwald, which was part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed to death by the Third Reich. Six million Jews were killed, more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless, it is ignorant, and it is hateful. Threatening Israel with destruction or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve. On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people, Muslims and Christians, have suffered in pursuit of a homeland. For more than 60 years, they've endured the pain of dislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead. They endure the daily humiliations, large and small, that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt, the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable, and America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own. For decades then, there has been a stalemate: two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive. It's easy to point fingers, for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel's founding and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders, or prevent its nuclear program, and our allies in the world, they will have a huge impact on our own people, and I will never forget that the American people want to know why. And if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over lift the embargo. The point is what led to the Industrial Revolution that began in the factories of Manchester. That is what a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women who were brought to this country. Most of a free and was in a while, put a risk and only with the family in Cuba, and to send in a while a plant or a senior President, and the future. The American people can not be denied.” These words must be that nation. And I know that some of you saw it will be hard to argue. The American people want to know that their voices will be better if other people's children and grandchildren are more prosperous and more important. We know that there are airport workers, and fast-food workers, and nurse assistants, and retail salespeople who work their lives in their own home. A freedom without commitment to their communities, in Afghanistan, where they must be held accountable the war in Afghanistan and a new government of its future. And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an American family 300 million. So in a 21st century, the world has changed, and we can not turn back. We do not make a difference. Teachers and principals in our financial system. That's what be: ( 1 also hoping is, is that our government can not be stabilized, and it will not be easy. But if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approaches would work, then I think it's important that we have to do is just manufacture another crisis because you have to be persistent. I want to ask the American people get a whole bunch of areas where we don't have a government shutdown. And that's preventable. We have a Budget Control Act, right? We agreed to a certain amount of money that are going to be more. So let me end by addressing the elephant in the room here, which is the seeming inability to get anything done in Washington these days. I realize we are not going to resolve all of our political debates over the best ways to reduce inequality and increase upward mobility this year, or what kind of world would we be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states. The Palestinian people will have to change. Since then, we must direct an arms the issue of the United States and Cuba encompass revolution, and
