The following project examines all presidential transcripts up to Donald's Trump speech on September 25, 2019. The source for the speeches was obtained from https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches. 

In this project, 992 transcripts were cleaned consisting of 3.8+ million words, or 22+ million characters. This project includes data exploration, sentiment analysis, transcripts generated using neural networks, topic modeling, and visualizations of term associations, empaths, term frequency, topic frequency, and word similarity.

The project can also be seen visually at https://jlilleberg.com/president_project/presidential_project_index.html which is best viewed on desktop.

If you would like to run the code yourself, run the following python script to install the required packages before running any notebooks.

```
python install_packages.py
```

Note, clean_speeches.ipynb takes a very significant amount of time to run so it's not recommended that you run this notebook unless you are adding more transcripts and need to clean the given texts.
